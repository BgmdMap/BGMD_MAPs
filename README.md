# Leveraging Feature Bias for Scalable Misprediction Explanation of Machine Learning Models
This is the repo that contains experimemnt data information and evaluation code for paper "Leveraging Feature Bias for Scalable Misprediction Explanation of Machine Learning Models". Here we present the evaluation data details and experiment results in Jupyternote books.

## Experiment results
### Bias Guided Misprediction Diagnoser (BGMD) 
The experiment results of comparing BGMD and EXPLAIN are under folder "BGMD_result".

### Mispredicted Area UPweight Sampling 
The experiment results of comparing MAPS, JTT and SMOTE are under folder "BGMD_result".


## Data
